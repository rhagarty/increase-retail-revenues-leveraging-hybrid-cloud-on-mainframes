# Increasing retail store revenues using IBM Z hybrid cloud
## Overview

To showcase the business challenges that a typical retail company might be experiencing, we share a case study about a fictitious retail company, which we refer to as **Breadbox Groceries**.  

![alt text](images/bbox-thestory.png "The story")

Today, they run three data centers across the country with IT reaching into the stores and distribution centers as well.  In the data centers, they host their core Business Support Systems on IBM Z. Supporting applications are hosted on IBM CICS® and IBM z/OS® Db2 systems.

One of the initiative for Breadbox was to implement the **virtual shopping list**. With this app, customers will be reminded that they need milk at the store the next time they go based on the purchasing history. 

![alt text](images/bbox-vsl.png "Virtual Shopping List")

## Architecture 

This diagram shows the Virtual Shopping List mobile application and two supporting microservices or web services: The Virtual Shopping List List Web Service (vsl-list-ws) and the Virtual Shopping List Recommendation Web Service (vsl-rec-ws).  

* The Recommendation Service is a simple recommendation engine, that finds patterns in customer’s purchases, mostly around durations between purchases, and makes recommendations for new purchases.  

* The List Service supports the mobile phone app (breadboxportal), by managing and persisting the list seen on the mobile phone app, merging in customer added items with customer selected recommendations.  

App users can add or ignore recommendations, can enter free form items, and can delete items at any time.  List Service has the smarts, and uses a  Cloudant database behind it, to maintain the current list.

     "_id": "074",
     "customerid": 1000114,
     "ibmid": "jessejes@example.com",
     "breadpoints": 10,
     "realname": "Jesse JES"
   }
   ```
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl027.png "Create app")

      * \_id should be between “001” and “100”.
      * customerid should be between 1000100 and 1000140 (inclusive: 1000100 and 1000140 are valid). 
      * ibmid should be a valid email address.  
      * breadpoints should be a valid number.

   4. When finished, click **Create Document**.

   The new user is now in place.
   
   ![alt text](images/vsl028.png "Create app")
   
## Configure and connect the Virtual Shopping List cloudant database
   
1. Create Cloudant Credentials to use in the Breadbox VSL app.

   1. Back to the IBM Cloud portal, Click **Service credentials** in the left navigation pane, and click **New credential**.

      ![alt text](images/vsl029.png "Create app")
   
   2. Provide a name for the credentials, click **Add**.

      ![alt text](images/vsl030.png "Create app")
   
      The credential is now in place.
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl031.png "Create app")

   3. You can use the **View credentials** Action to view the assigned credential.  These will be used later.

      ![alt text](images/vsl032.png "Create app")

2. Connect Cloudant Credentials to the **Breadbox portal** app.

   1. Click **Connections** in the left navigation pane, and click **Create connection**.

      ![alt text](images/vsl033.png "Create app")
   
   2. Select the **breadboxportal app**, and click **Connect**.

      ![alt text](images/vsl034.png "Create app")

   3. Click on the Restage button.

      ![alt text](images/vsl035.png "Create app")

      The Cloudant NoSQL DB service is now connected to the breadboxportal app.
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl037.png "Create app")

3. Connect Cloudant Credentials to the **vsllistws** app. 

   1. Repeat the procedures from the previous step.	

4. Connect Cloudant Credentials to the **vslrecws** app.
   
   1. Repeat the procedures from the previous step. 
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl039.png "Create app")
   
5. To see the results of this new Connection (for example, Breadbox portal app):

   * Click **Breadboxportal** conection.  
   
   * Click **Runtime** tab in the left navigation pane, and click ** Environmental variables** in the center selector.
   
   ![alt text](images/vsl040.png "Create app")
      
   We see the cloudantNoSQLDB environment variable that will be passed to the breadboxportal Cloud Foundary application, so that credentials don’t need to be in the code.  It’s a little odd that the VCAP_SERVICE environment variable above isn’t cloudantconfig, to match the service name, but it works somehow.  ;-) 
   
   ![alt text](images/vsl041.png "Create app")

## Create the VSL app shared secret user defined environmental variable 

The environmental variable **JWT_SHARED_SECRET** needs to be identical across breadboxportal, vsllistws, and vslrecws.  This shared secret is used to encrypt and decrypt the JSON web token (JWT) passed between breadboxportal, vslistws and vslrecws.

1. Create the shared secret user defined environmental variable for the breadboxportal app.

   1. Navigate to **Bluemix** / **Cloud Foundry Apps** / **Breadbox portal App**.
   
   2. Click **Runtime** in the left navigation pane.
   
   3. Click **Environmental variables** in the center selector.
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl040.png "Create app")
   
   4. Scroll down to the **User defined** section,  Click ** Add**. 
   
      ![alt text](images/vsl042.png "Create app")
   
   5. Create a new user-defined environmental variable.  Enter:
   
      * Name: **JWT_SHARED_SECRET**  (must be uppercase). 
      * Value: **{"secret": "20-character-random-string"}** where 20-character-random-string can contain upper, lower case characters and numbers.
    
   6. click **Save**.
 
      ![alt text](images/vsl044.png "Create app")
   
      The app will be restarted automatically. 
  
2. Create the shared secret user defined environmental variable for the vsllistws app.

   * Repeat procedures from the previous step. 
   
3. Create the shared secret user defined environmental variable for the vslrecws app.  
   
   * Repeat procedures from the previous step. 
  
# Part 4. Test the Virtual Shopping List mobile app end-to-end

7. Upload the actual working code and overlaid the placholder for your vsl listing web service app.
   
   1. Navigate to the vsllistws directory.
   
   2. Push the code to IBM Cloud.  Enter:
      ```
      bx app push vsllistws-something-unique
      ```
     
8. Upload the actual working code and overlaid the placholder for your vsl recommendation web service app.
   
   1. Navigate to the vslrecws directory.
   
   2. Push the code to IBM Cloud. Enter:
      ```
      bx app push vslrecws-something-unique
      ```   
> IMPORTANT:  When issuing the bx cf push commands, its very important to issue the commands for a given application from within the directory for that application.  If this is not done, application hosts get cross wired, and your applications will start to be unreachable intermittently, as IBM Cloud seems to associate multiple routes with the same application, when a cross wired push is done.  If cross wiring occurs, the IBM Cloud portal can be used to edit the application routes, and delete unintended routes.  Use the Routes button in the upper left corner of any detailed views (Overview, Runtime, Logs, etc.) for the application.
 
9. As a quick check for proof that the actual working Breadbox Recommendation Service is running.  
   
   1. Click on the URL for the vslrecws app.

   This sample portal, mobile application lacks user login.  Developers may choose to add user login themselves.  The sample redirects directly to the mobile application screen.  

## Explore the mobile Virtual Shopping List app

1. Select the Virtual Shopping List app on the mobile phone.

   ![alt text](images/vsl066.png "Create app")

   The top two rows are recommendations coming from the Recommendation web service based on the customer purchase history coming from z/OS Connect!
    
   ![alt text](images/vsl067.png "Create app")
  
2. You can use the plus (+) sign to add recommendations to your shopping list.  The shopping list is persisted in the cloud, in the Cloudant database.

   ![alt text](images/vsl068.png "Create app")

3. To get further validation that our integration of the engaging mobile app in the cloud, with the customer purchase history on IBM Z, you can double check the Recommendation web service log in IBM Cloud to see the recommendations coming from the analyze-history call. 

   ![alt text](images/vsl064.png "Create app")

4. We can also see the raw response from the API on the Developer Portal.

   ![alt text](images/vsl065.png "Create app")

5. The cloudant "users" “rec” and “vsl” databases are self-priming, based on use of the portal, mobile app.  Using the Cloudant management UI, You can see that the databases are working properly. 
   
   1. Navigate back to the Cloud management UI, and navigate to the Databases view.  

   2. Select the **users** table. Click the pencil in the upper right to view/edit the document.
 
      ![alt text](images/vsl069.png "Create app")
  
      Jesse now has 12 breadpoints!

   3. Select the **rec** table. Click the pencil in the upper right to view/edit the document. Similarly, the recommendations for Jesse JES (_id=1000114) are in this database.

      ![alt text](images/vsl070.png "Create app")
    
   4. Select the **vsl** table. Click the pencil in the upper right to view/edit the document. The items that Jesse JES added manually to his virtual shopping list is now in this database.

# Part 5. IBM Watson Analytics on Breadbox Customer Purchase History

In this section, you will explore and gain insights from Breadbox Groceries customer purchase history. This data exploration can have immense business value, looking for trends, such as products selling well, not so well, for specific customers, trends in customer retention, customer purchase volume per visit, customer visits to more than one store – the possibilities are endless.  Armed with insights, Breadbox Groceries might use the Virtual Shopping List mobile application to insert promotions to target customers, that might improve number of visits, quantity of purchases per visit, etc.  After the promotion period, the results can be measured by further analytics on customer purchase history.  In this section, we’ll use the API we created, to gather customer purchase history for various customers, feed that information into IBM Watson Analytics, running in the IBM Cloud, to see what types of insights are possible.

## Gather and format Breadbox customer purchase history
 
In the first Experience, we saw that the customerHistory API returns a large json document.  The API returns data for a single customer.  One tricky part is that IBM Watson Analytics doesn’t process json, so you will have to convert the API json response to CSV format. 

There is a prepared CSV file **result.csv** which contains purchase history for customer 1000100. You can find it in the files you downladed earlier from github.   

```
ls increase-retail-revenues-leveraging-hybrid-cloud-on-mainframes/result.csv
```

*If you prefer to use this file, please skip this section and proceed to [5.2. Log in to IBM Watson Analytics](5.2.-log-in-to- IBM-Watson-Analytics) 

1. Retrieve customer history for a customer.

   There are a number of tools, techniques to do an API request.  Using curl is shown here.

   ``` 
   curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.us.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/spbodieusibmcom-prod/developer-contest/breadbox /customerHistory?customer_number=1000100&request_date=2013-09-01' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-ibm-client-id: df2fecbf-01f5-41ed-90c0-2b8883db2a3b' \
     --header 'x-ibm-client-secret: -----------------------------------------'
   ```
   
2. Convert results from json to csv format.

   There are several ways to convert json to csv.  In this example, a json2csv node module was used, found at: https://github.com/zemirco/json2csv#command-line-interface

   Here is a sample session to convert json to csv at the command line, using the node module json2csv.  

   >IMPORTANT:  One slightly hidden step is to trim the json response to only the details portion of the response (ca_order_detail), the main part of the response, the long array of strings, between the square brackets:  [  … ].  The vi editor is used to remove the front and back matter, to leave the square brackets and everything in between.

# Part 6. Suggestions for extending this application

The purpose for this sample app is a starting point for additional “hacks” that can be done. Here are some ideas on possible hacks:

1. Convert to a fully mobile optimized web application – a full phone/tablet web app.
2. Add Google or Facebook authentication
3. Add contests, reward programs
4. Improve the recommendation engine: better algorithms, consider other facts like day of the week, season, location, drive coupons, specials to the user
5. Analytics on customer purchase history to find, track customer retention issues, etc.
